% First we load data from the lungs:
%   1. segments: it contains the 20 patch structures for each of the 
%      representation of each of the 20 segments
%   2. Xarxa: is a matrix obtained from the previous one and addition data.
%      The first three columns of the matrix contain cartesina coordinates
%      for each point of 2, this has been computed with addition data that
%      stablished the ditance in milimeteres between points in 1, in the x,
%      y and z directions. The fourth column of this matrix states numbers
%      1 or 2 if it correspond to the left or right lung, and the fifth
%      column has numbers from 1 to 20 for each lobe.    

load segments.mat % 1
load xarxa.mat    % 2

% Separate the matrix Xarxa into a the column stablishing the segments and 
% the another matrix containing the cooridnates for each point and a fourth
% column to identify the points.
SE = Xarxa(:,5);      % Segments numbered (1 to 20)
Xarxa = Xarxa(:,1:4); % Forth colum 1 or 2 for right and left lung respectively

% TRACHEA
dTraq = 8.1; % Tracha diameter

% Matrix contaning all branches: each row is a bronchial branch
% Meaning of each column:
%  1: How many branches there are between this one and the trachea
%  2: In which row is its mother branch
%  3: Diameter
%  4: Longitude
%  5: xi, initial x coordinate
%  6: yi, initial y coordinate
%  7: zi, initial z coordinate
%  8: xf, final x coordinate
%  9: yf, final y coordinate
% 10: zf, final z coordinate
% 11: birth, number of daughter branches emerging from it
% 12: vx, x coordinate of its mother's vector
% 13: vy, y coordinate of its mother's vector
% 14: vz, z coordinate of its mother's vector
% 15: angle, angle of bifrucation of its mother's branch
% 16: lobe, integer refering to the lobe they irrigate, if they are leading
%     branches it is 0
